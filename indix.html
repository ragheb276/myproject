                COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and
                airways.
              </p>

              <p>
                It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered in
                December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
              </p>
              <p>
                Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever,
                cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more
                severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute
                respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
              </p>
              <p>
                Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include
                regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and
                sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact
                with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as
                coughing and sneezing.

                          This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei
                          Province, China. The first infections were linked to a
                          live animal market, but the virus is now spreading
                          from person-to-person. It’s important to note that
                          person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum.
                          Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles),
                          while other viruses are less so.

                          Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread
                          the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that
                          these patients be isolated either in the hospital or
                          at home (depending on how sick they are) until they
                          are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting

                          weather months but that does not mean it is impossible
                          to become sick with these viruses during other months.

                          Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from
                          person-to-person through respiratory droplets.
                          Currently there is no evidence to support transmission
                          of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or
                          eating food it is important to always wash your hands
                          with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
                          safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
                          blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to
                          the bathroom.

                          It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by
                          touching a surface or object that has the virus on it
                          and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly
                          their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way
                          the virus spreads.

                          In general, because of poor survivability of these
                          coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low
                          risk of spread from food products or packaging that
                          are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient,
                          refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                          your national and local public health authority. Many
                          countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19
                          and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China
                          and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or
                          stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is
                          unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

                              wear a facemask (for example, because it causes
                              trouble breathing), you, as the caregiver, should
                              wear a mask when you are in the same room as the
                              patient.

                          and others; when you go out in public, keep away from

                          hands often; and avoid crowds, cruise travel, and
                          non-essential travel. If there is an outbreak in your

                          Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms
                          (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may
                          have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used
                          once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who
                          is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a
                          world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to
                          use masks wisely.

                          The most effective ways to protect yourself and others
                          against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands,
                          cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and
                          maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from

                          The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever,
                          tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches
                          and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat
                          or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin
                          gradually. Some people become infected but don’t
                          develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most
                          people (about 80%) recover from the disease without
                          needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6
                          people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and
                          develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those
                          with underlying medical problems like high blood
                          pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely
                          to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough
                          and difficulty breathing should seek medical
                          attention.

                          This is a new virus and we are still learning about
                          it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of
                          illness in children. Most illness, including serious
                          illness, is happening in adults of working age and
                          older adults. If there cases of COVID-19 that impact
                          your child’s school, the school may dismiss students.
                          Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
                          Read or watch local media sources that report school
                          dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use
                          alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.

                          notify their childcare facility or school. Talk with
                          teachers about classroom assignments and activities
                          they can do from home to keep up with their
                          schoolwork.

                          the spread of COVID-19 in the community.

                          Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from

                          Currently there is no evidence to support transmission
                          of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or
                          eating food it is important to always wash your hands
                          with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
                          safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
                          blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to
                          the bathroom.

                          It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by
                          touching a surface or object that has the virus on it
                          and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly
                          their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way
                          the virus spreads.

                          coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low
                          risk of spread from food products or packaging that
                          are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient,
                          refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                          transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and

                          reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself
                          against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.

                            No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal
                            vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib)
                            vaccine, do not provide protection against the new

                            The virus is so new and different that it needs its
                            own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a
                            vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting
                            their efforts.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Although these vaccines are not effective against
                            2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses
                            is highly recommended to protect your health.
